Games made in C which help me practice the language

Disclaimer: Not all are games (lol)

## color.h

Adds nice colors to the terminal

## myterm.h

Allows for the terminal to be changed to unbuffered and non-canonical, etc.

## select.h

My first test of the elipse "..." operator was actually unnecessary...
But this header is still pretty neat!
Allows you to make different selections between strings, quite useful.
(Should be used in unbuffered and non-canonical mode i.e. "setTerm(0);")

## tetris.c

The latest coding challenge I took on. Currently doesn't have a speed up mechanism.

## HH.c (Henderson-Hasselbalch)

Calculates the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation of equilibrium for you! Makes life easy (easier)
